# Java Bean Journey Server
## BBD Grad Program | Java Level Up

Welcome to the Bean Escape Text-Based Game Server repository for the BBD Grad Program Java Level Up!

This server is part of a collaborative project involving four developers over a two-week period. The goal is to build a client-server architecture in Java, connecting to a database to manage information about game states and transitions for the "Bean Escape" game. In this game, players assume the role of a brave bean attempting to escape from the clutches of the bean packaging facility.

   [Add instructions for running the server]

Once the server is running, clients can connect to it using the API to help the bean escape from the packaging facility.
